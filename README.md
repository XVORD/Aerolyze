# I. Introduction to the problem and the solution

Gas leaks, such as LPG or carbon monoxide (CO), pose significant risks to household safety, leading to fires, explosions, or poisoning if not detected promptly. Traditional detection methods, relying on manual observation or standalone alarms, often result in delayed responses, increasing the potential for harm to lives and property. The rapid spread of hazardous gases underscores the need for a reliable, proactive monitoring system to address these challenges.

Aerolyze offers an innovative solution with a smart gas leakage detection system that ensures real-time monitoring, immediate alerts, and automated responses. Leveraging IoT technology, the device utilizes the MQ-2 sensor to detect LPG and CO gases, providing digital notifications via WhatsApp and integrated auditory and visual warnings through a buzzer and LED. This comprehensive approach empowers users to act swiftly, effectively minimizing risks and enhancing household safety.


## Features

- **Detect LPG and toxic carbon monoxide (CO) gases:** Keep an eye Aerolyze utilizes the MQ-2 sensor to detect hazardous gases such as LPG and toxic carbon monoxide (CO), ensuring accurate and continuous monitoring of household air quality.
- **Give real-time alerts using buzzer and red LED:** The device activates an integrated buzzer and red LED to deliver immediate auditory and visual warnings when dangerous gas levels are detected, ensuring residents are promptly alerted to potential threats.
- **Give notification to user by Whatsapp:** Aerolyze sends real-time notifications to the user's WhatsApp, providing instant updates and enabling swift action to address the detected hazard.
